## Application information

TikSta is a smart application with convenient user interface which will help to choose the most relevant and trending hashtags for posts even considering the limits set by TikTok and Instagram for the length of the post and, of course, the length of users' post if they paste it

It also has a blog, where we post some interesting groups of hashtags which will exactly help users to promote their TikTok and Instagram accounts. There users can find hashtags for different topics or top trending and most posted and viewed hashtags.
